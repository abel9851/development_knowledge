The **hexadecimal string "89504e47"** is the **signature** or **magic number** of a **PNG (Portable Network Graphics)** file. This sequence is used to identify a file as a PNG image when it's opened or processed by software.

### Breakdown of the Hexadecimal String:

- **0x89**: A non-printable byte (in the ASCII table, 0x89 is not a printable character, but it's part of the PNG signature).
- **0x50**: This corresponds to the ASCII character **'P'**.
- **0x4E**: This corresponds to the ASCII character **'N'**.
- **0x47**: This corresponds to the ASCII character **'G'**.

### What happens when decoding "89504e47"?

- The **"89504e47"** is the **PNG file signature** (the first four bytes of a PNG file).
- When you decode it, you're likely using a tool or program that converts the hexadecimal representation to its ASCII equivalents.

### Why do you see **".PNG"**?

- When decoding this string, the tool you're using might be interpreting it as **ASCII characters** for the **"P", "N", "G"** bytes (0x50, 0x4E, 0x47), and then appending a **"."** because **0x89** (the first byte) is a non-printable byte, and the decoder might show a placeholder like a dot (".") for non-printable characters.
- In some cases, software may choose to replace non-printable characters with visible ones like a dot, so you might see **".PNG"** as a result.

### Why the "dot" is shown:

The byte **0x89** is **non-printable** in ASCII, so the decoding software might choose to show a **dot (".")** as a placeholder for it. The rest of the sequence (0x50, 0x4E, 0x47) corresponds to the letters **"P", "N", "G"**, which are printable characters, so you see **".PNG"**.

### Conclusion:

- **"89504e47"** is the signature for PNG files, and it helps identify a file as a PNG image.
- The **dot (".")** is a placeholder for the non-printable byte **0x89**.
- The printable part of the signature is **"PNG"**, which is why you see **".PNG"** when decoding the bytes.

so, converting 89504e47 to .PNG means decoding using ascii?

Yes, **converting "89504e47" to ".PNG"** essentially involves interpreting the hexadecimal bytes using an **ASCII decoding method**, but it's important to understand that the **"89504e47"** sequence is specifically the **PNG file signature**.

### Here's the breakdown:

1. **0x89**: This byte is **non-printable** in standard ASCII, meaning it doesn't correspond to a visible character. Many tools may replace non-printable characters with a placeholder (like a dot or a question mark), which is why you see **"."** in the output.
    
2. **0x50**: This corresponds to the **ASCII character "P"**.
    
3. **0x4E**: This corresponds to the **ASCII character "N"**.
    
4. **0x47**: This corresponds to the **ASCII character "G"**.
    

### Why you see **".PNG"**:

When you decode the hexadecimal string **"89504e47"**, you are likely using a program or tool that converts the bytes to **ASCII** values. However, since **0x89** is non-printable in the **ASCII** encoding, it is represented as a dot **"."** in the output. The other three bytes, **0x50**, **0x4E**, and **0x47**, correspond to **'P'**, **'N'**, and **'G'**, respectively.

Therefore, the output **".PNG"** is a combination of:

- **"."**: A placeholder for **0x89** (a non-printable byte),
- **"P"**: Decoded from **0x50**,
- **"N"**: Decoded from **0x4E**,
- **"G"**: Decoded from **0x47**.

### Summary:

- **"89504e47"** is the file signature for a **PNG** image file.
- When you decode it, you get a mix of **non-printable (0x89)** and **printable characters ("P", "N", "G")**.
- Some tools or decoders will show **"."** for the non-printable byte, leading to the result **".PNG"**.
